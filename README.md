## User Story
**As A** developer,  
**I WANT** a tool to generate a team profile,  
**SO THAT** I can easily organize and view information about my team members.

Hi everyone! This is Muradhan. I am a construction project manager of 10 years whom always had an interest overt the IT industry. Finally decided to make the switch, and started the EdX's Front end development boot camp to switch his field of work. 

In this assignment, my task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a that generates Team Profile from a user's input using the Inquirer packageLinks to an external site.. 

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, users can clone the repository from GitHub and install the project by following these steps:

1. Initialize the project:
```bash
npm init -y
```
2. Install Inquirer for user prompts:
```bash
npm i inquirer@6.3.1
```
3. Install Jest for testing:
```bash
npm i jest
```
4. Update test script in package.json:
Edit the `"test"` script in the `package.json` file (line 10) to use Jest
```bash
"test": "jest"
```
5. Run tests:
```bash
npm run test
```
